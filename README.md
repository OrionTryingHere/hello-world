My name is Orion, and this is what's up.
When I drink I get blackout drunk.
I like to play chess--I got a board in my trunk.
When I get high I stare up at the stars
and listen... To the passing of the cars.
I know I got reason and I got some rhyme.
If you get me fucked up, I speak my fuckin mind.
Talk about love; Talk about life.
Talk out your problems and end all your strife!
But if I get real drunk and I really wanna drive,
please take my keys. So I know I'll survive. 
Because I've have some accidents back in the day.
None of them fatal, I'm happy to say.
